# Instructions  

  Now it's time for you to build out this game. The objective is to hit 100 points.

  The game should work like this:

  1. The game starts at 0, 0 for the score.
  2. Player One goes first.
  3. Clicking the "Throw Darts" button shows a random number in the score graphic of 1 - 20.
  4. That number adds to the Score.
  5. Player Two goes next.
  6. Steps 3 and 4 happen.
  7. After this the players alternate.The score should keep incrementing.
  8. Whoever reaches 100 points wins. Show a message saying which player wins.
  9. Reset the game to 0,0.

## Improvements:

Once you've done the basics, improve the game by:

1. Fixing the probabilities of hitting different numbers on the dart board.
2. Do something special when a player gets a 20 or bullseye.
3. Make the UI pretty.
